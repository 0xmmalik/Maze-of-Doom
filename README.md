## Instructions
Use the arrow keys and Q, W, A, S keys to move (Q, W, A, and S are for their respective diagonals). Get the key (`&`) to be able to climb up a floor using the transporters (`O`) and collect money (`$`) along the way to boost your score. Be sure to avoid lava (`%`) because it will reduce your score! Get to the top as fast as you can!

## Version History

## System Requirements
For many of my other games, Windows was not a requirement, but for this game, it *is*!

**Windows is necesssary**, and any version will suffice

**You need a faster computer**, otherwise, you will face lag and moments where the screen blinks every time you move.

## Module Requirements
- Python 3.4+
- Pygame (any version)

## File Requirements
The `.py` file is the only file!
